## Prologue

Life is an organized state that maintains itself using energy.
When the conditions for life are improved, it grows to fill the new space made available to it.
Life will always press on its boundaries until its boundaries press back on it.
Whoever seeks to improve the conditions for life must therefore believe that some ways of struggling are better than others.
In the end, where we draw our boundaries is a matter of aesthetic preference.
