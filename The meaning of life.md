## Chapter 2: The meaning of life

### Part 1: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs

#### Introduction

The American psychologist Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) categorized human needs into 5 discrete levels ordered according to their relative importance.
We prioritize the needs of lower levels over those of higher ones because fulfilling them brings a faster increase in our total sense of fulfillment.

#### Level 1: Physiological needs

The most fundamental needs, called physiological needs, concern the maintenance of equilibrium in our bodily processes, a phenomenon known as homeostasis.
Some of the variables that need to be kept under tight control are temperature, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, electrolyte concentrations, and blood pressure.
Organs like the kidneys, lungs, and heart are constantly at work regulating these variables.
For them to be able to do their job, we need to make sure that we have fresh air in our lungs, food and water in our bellies, and a roof over our heads.

#### Level 2: Safety needs

When our bodies are in a healthy condition, we work on fulfilling our safety needs, which means getting the physiological needs secured beyond the present moment by finding a territory granting reliable access to the resources needed to fulfill them.
Since we humans are social creatures who fulfill our needs with the help of others, we fulfill level 2 in practice by finding a way to fulfill the needs of our society.

#### Level 3: Love and belonging

Once we can afford to spend some time and attention on forming relationships with other people, we want to fulfill our need for love and belonging.
A safe environment means that potential offspring have a decent chance to survive, we hence begin seeking sexual partners with whom to create new life.
We also begin seeking allies with whom to exchange ideas, join territories, and cooperate to expand our common territory.

#### Level 4: Esteem

While level 2 is fulfilled by being accepted by society according to a common standard and level 3 by finding some people who recognize our own unique qualities, our need for esteem is fulfilled by earning recognition for our unique qualities from society at large.
We achieve this by finding a way to utilize these qualities to do something for society that not anyone could do, such as taking on a key role in an organization.

#### Level 5: Self-actualization

Level 4 naturally extends into the need for self-actualization, which can be seen as a desire to use those qualities that remain unused.
We sense that the world is missing out on something, and we feel obliged to show it.
The difference between level 4 and level 5 may seem a matter of degree rather than kind, but such an interpretation would miss a crucial point.
When seeking esteem, we try to fit ourselves into a system by adjusting ourselves.
We put on a uniform that shows the system what to expect from us and shows us what to expect in return.
When seeking self-actualization, on the other hand, we try to fit a system onto ourselves by adjusting it.
We try to give something that nobody has asked of us and must therefore have no expectations of reward.

#### Transcendence
That was the fifth and final step in the hierarchy of needs proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943, and who would not be satisfied after coming this far?
That’s right, Abraham Maslow.
After his death in 1970, notes about a suggested sixth step were discovered, which he called transcendence or self-transcendence.
It means to go beyond oneself and refers to the need to feel unified with the outside world.
In the words of Maslow himself: “Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos" (Wikipedia: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs).
Being able to identify with more than our physical bodies makes us altruistic and at peace with the prospect of death.

#### Wisdom

The levels in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs may seem to correspond to phases we go through over our lifetimes, but that is not the whole story.
A need that has become fulfilled spontaneously becomes unfulfilled unless actively maintained.
Every need must thus be fulfilled over and over throughout our lives.
How much time we spend fulfilling a need is proportional to how much fulfillment it yields per unit of time and how long it takes to fulfill and inversely proportional to how long it remains fulfilled.
Through practice, we can improve our strategy for fulfilling a need to leave more time, energy, and attention for fulfilling other ones.
Our ability to fulfill our needs is what we call wisdom, which is the product of experience and intelligence.
Since needs can be fulfilled in different ways in different environments, our wisdom decreases when our environment changes.

#### Satisfaction
A need being fulfilled or not is a matter of degree, and to what degree it has to be fulfilled for us to feel satisfied is determined by what options are available to us.
Having more options for fulfilling a need raises our bar for what is good enough and forces us to work harder to satisfy it.
On the other hand, since what matters to us is the total fulfillment from all sources rather than the maximum fulfillment of any particular need, we need to work less to satisfy a need the more options we have for fulfilling other ones.

#### Leveling up

Lower-level needs are both fulfilled and unfulfilled more quickly than higher-level ones.
Consequently, we expand our time frame for every step up in the hierarchy we take.
We barely have to plan at all for when we are going to eat, sleep, or take our next breath of air, but we have to plan days ahead for how we are going to stuff our fridge and months ahead for how we are going to afford our living expenses.
Close relationships develop over months to years and skills over years to decades.
Projects, businesses, and organizations may even extend in scope beyond our own lifetimes.

Apart from expanding our time frame, each higher level increases the number of people we sympathize with.
We fulfill our safety needs when we help ourselves, our need for love and belonging when we help our friends and families, our need for esteem when we help our society, and our need for self-actualization when we help the world.

We can also conclude that fulfilling the needs of one level gives us the tools to fulfill those of the next.
Fulfilling our physiological needs gives us the energy to fulfill our safety needs, which gives us the time to fulfill our need for love and belonging, which gives us the confidence to fulfill our need for esteem, which gives us the skills to fulfill our need for self-actualization.

Lastly, there seems to be a childhood and an adult version of every level, where we as children can have our needs fulfilled for us by someone else, while we as adults have to be able to fulfill them for ourselves and others. If we get all our needs fulfilled in childhood, we can transcend into adulthood where we start over from level 1.

### Part 2: Conflicts of interest

#### Friends and enemies

Other people can both help us fulfill our needs and prevent us from doing it.
Whether our interactions with other people become friendly or hostile depends on the abundance and availability of resources in our environment.
If a resource is both abundant and easily extractable, we can get it without resorting to either competition or collaboration.
In such a scenario, there are likely to be few relationships of any kind.
If a resource is abundant but not easily extractable, collaboration can increase access to it for everyone.
Such conditions thereby favor mutually beneficial relationships.
If a resource is scarce, we have to compete with others to obtain it, which makes relationships more likely to be hostile.
This is particularly the case when the scarce resource also is easily extractable since that would leave nothing to be gained from collaboration.

#### Moral systems

Conflicts of interest are settled through moral systems, which legislate how the people involved are allowed to affect the outcome.
Our ability to affect outcomes in a given moral system can be referred to as our power in that system.
In the natural moral system, power is the ability to inflict and resist violence.
Artificial moral systems arise when we form relationships within which we collaborate to fulfill some of our needs but compete for the fulfillment of other ones.
We could, for example, collaborate to fulfill our safety needs by sharing vital resources and refraining from violence while we keep competing for sex and coastal real estate.
We would then need to replace violence with other forms of power as means of settling conflicts of interest.

In an economic system, power is money, which we get by fulfilling other people’s needs.
In a democratic system, power is votes, which we get by participating in the democratic system.
In a social system, power is attention, which we get by fulfilling our own needs.
Since artificial moral systems rely on their participants agreeing on a common set of principles, they are vulnerable to the possibility that some of them might break this agreement.
When the participants of an economic system cannot agree on property rights or the participants of a democratic system cannot agree on the right to vote, might is right resumes its role in adjudicating conflicts of interest.
The contractual terms of an artificial moral system must therefore be enforced in the natural moral system to be maintained, which is why we have police, military, mafia, and blood oaths.
Since an artificial moral system is a collaborative effort by its participants to fulfill their needs, every participant must be better off for being part of it and make its other participants better off in return.

#### The outcome of conflicts of interest

Our chance of winning a conflict of interest is equal to our power relative to that of our competitors.
If what we compete for is divisible, our relative power equals the share of it we are likely to obtain.
What matters is not only how much power we have but how much of it we are willing to use, a factor we can call interest.
With twice the power but half the interest, we would use the same amount of power to attain the outcome, giving us an equal chance of winning.
The power of a group is equal to the sum of the power used by its constituents multiplied by some factor for how efficiently they collaborate.
