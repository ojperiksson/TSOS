## Chapter 1: Reality

#### Introduction

I want to begin this manuscript of life that I intend to write with a discussion about God and the devil.
As a measly introduction, the story goes that God is the creator of the universe, who weaved into its fabric the laws by which everything within it must abide.
The devil, on the other hand, is his rebellious son, who is ever intent on proving dad's creation faulty.
We who exist are grateful to God for having created us.
Whatever process has brought us here we consider, in essence, good.
When we look around us, however, we see that everything is, in fact, not so good.
We see good things being destroyed, and we consider it evil.
Keep reading to reconcile with the contradictory nature of existence.

#### Physical reality

God defines the building blocks of reality.
Based on the properties he assigns them, laws arise that determine how the building blocks interact and how they can organize themselves into ordered states.
Due to the limited supply of building blocks, alternative ordered states have to compete for them.
The state that obeys God’s laws more precisely will be more stable than its alternatives.
With time it will replace them, until an even more stable state has formed that in turn will replace it.

Having proved itself more obedient than its predecessors, the current state is the most perfect expression of God’s laws that can be referenced.
For any alternative state to challenge it would seem foolish to the point that the only inferable incentive could be malevolence.
The potential alternative state is the devil, and as long as he lurks around the corner, God's creation is a work in progress.
The devil is a threat to everything that exists, but from the point of view of existence as a whole, he is the fuel keeping it spinning.

In theory, there is a potential perfect state that adheres maximally to God’s laws so that it cannot be challenged by any alternative.
This is what some religions refer to as heaven or nirvana and some ideologies refer to as peace, equality, or sustainability.
In physics, it is referred to as the heat death of the universe.
It is a state where the last trace of disobedience has been subdued and no outside influence can reach in to incite new disobedience.

As the most stable configurations of building blocks keep being selected, they eventually become stable enough to serve as building blocks themselves.
As these new building blocks form new ordered states, which in turn become another set of building blocks, we can imagine reality sedimenting into layers, where a new layer begins to settle as the previous one stabilizes.
The laws governing each layer depend on the properties of its building blocks, which are defined by the state of the previous layer.
Each layer thus refers to the layer below it as its God.

#### Virtual reality

As we currently understand the universe, its most basic building blocks are subatomic particles governed by the laws of particle physics.
The subatomic particles form atoms, which form molecules, which miraculously have gone on to form cells.

The principal component of a cell is the complex molecule DNA, which is a chain of simpler molecules called nucleotides, which come in four variants that can connect to each other in variable order.
DNA serves as a template for complex molecules called proteins, which are folded chains of simpler molecules called amino acids.
Proteins can be described as little machines that work together with DNA to keep the cell and its environment in a desirable state.
The order of nucleotides in DNA determines the order of amino acids in the proteins and thereby their shape and function.

The stretch of DNA that codes for a particular protein is called the gene for that protein.
To start producing its protein, a gene must be activated by a specific combination of other proteins called transcription factors.
Transcription factors may activate a new gene in response to a change in some important variable inside or outside the cell.
The resulting protein may constitute an adequate response by itself, or it may be a new transcription factor that, together with other transcription factors, goes on to activate genes for other proteins, which in turn have the same option.

We can think of activated genes as virtual building blocks being used to construct responses.
What distinguishes them from physical building blocks is that neither the genes nor the proteins they produce are physically incorporated into the genes they activate.
What is incorporated is the information the genes convey, communicated by their proteins.
A gene that is activated by a combination of other genes takes all the information conveyed by those genes into account when deciding whether to produce its protein.
It can then take advantage of the information contained in other genes by delegating sub-responses to them.

Cells can exist as organisms of their own, or they can organize themselves into multicellular organisms, which in turn can organize themselves into groups.
Some multicellular organisms contain a particularly interesting type of cells called neurons, which are the components of the nervous system, which serves a similar function in those organisms as DNA does in the cell.

A neuron receives electrical signals from sensory cells or other neurons through connecting wires.
Upon receiving enough such signals, it becomes activated, meaning that it sends its own electrical signal to muscle fibers or other neurons.
With activated neurons as virtual building blocks, the organism constructs a representation of its environment, which it responds to with a series of coordinated muscle contractions.
The connections between neurons can change in response to experience, enabling us to adapt our responses to the environment we are in.

#### Ideas

The collected connections of a single neuron is what we call an idea.
Together, the ideas in our brains form a model of the world, which we can call our mind or soul.
As alternative material forms compete in physical reality, alternative ideas compete within the mind.
Which ideas take root depends on our environment, our brain's inherent reinforcement mechanisms, which ideas are already present, and which behaviors we are physically able to perform successfully.

Apart from learning from our own experiences, we can learn from what other people have learned through communication.
Because the ideas communicated by others become part of the reality we use to validate our own ideas, we end up sharing ideas with the people we communicate with.
A set of ideas that is shared by multiple individuals is what we call a religion or an ideology.
When we speak of culture, we refer to the whole set of ideas within a group, which may not be found in its entirety in any single member of that group.
Ideas that are communicated may or may not benefit the recipient, but they must always benefit the communicator.

While our ideas are shaped by our recurring encounters with reality, they simultaneously impose themselves on reality through our behavior.
Ideas can give rise to buildings, machines, art, and relationships and can lead their hosts to prosperity or ruin.
When an idea has defeated its competitors in the mind of a host, it takes its fight for survival from the mind to the outside world, where it strives to keep its host walking and talking.
Its greatest wish is to survive its host, be passed on from generation to generation, and leave a lasting mark on the world so that nobody will ever doubt its existence.
To succeed in that endeavor, the idea has to encode the laws of reality more accurately than its competitors.
While a parasitic idea that short-circuits the brain’s reinforcement mechanisms may gain traction in a population, it will eventually be outcompeted by an idea that shows the world as it is, even if the only way it can go down is by taking its host down with it.

#### How to befriend the devil

When we die, our ideas can live on in the people we have influenced.
If they find any of them worth keeping, they will reassemble them into something that is not quite us but in which we would nonetheless recognize ourselves.

We who now live have inherited ideas from a long line of struggling individuals.
These ideas form a map of the world guiding us through the maze of human existence.
Being so fortunate, we might expect life to be easy, but it is not.
Our noble attempts to follow God are disrupted by the satanic urge to reject the gift that is handed to us.
We sense that the tree our forefathers climbed has decayed and that our children will inherit nothing when the parasite-infested branch we hold on to breaks under our weight.
Without a map, our bloodlines would already have reached a dead end.
But if God is not finished, bowing down to a graven image is doomed to blind us to the new sun on the horizon.
To gain the world, we have to forfeit our souls.
But being willing to go to hell to save other people from it may be the most Christlike thing we could do.
So say your prayers and let the bricks fall where they may.
The devil is the player and God is the game.
